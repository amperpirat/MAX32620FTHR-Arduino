* 
* 
* Aim: If you want to connect only a battery to the MAX32620FTHR board and 
* run any application, you have to initialize the boards PWR-hold-GPIO to 
* be high. Otherwise the PMIC will shut down the system after few moments.
* This example will only work with connected battery and NO USB input!
* 
* Function: 
* Press Power-On-Button
*           v
* configure the MAX77650
*           v
* Do some Application stuff
*           v
*   Goto Power-Off state        
*
